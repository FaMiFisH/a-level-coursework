This is my A-level Computer Science coursework. 

The exams got cancelled half way through the academic year due to COVID therefore the documentation was not submitted to be marked. However I have continued to work on my project in order to improve my programming skills and to become more familiar with android development. 

I am using googles Cloud Firestore database because it is not only super compatible with mobile development - as it is a Realtime Database - but also the infrastructure for the database is already available, you just need to establish connection with the console on the website. It is important to mention that it is a NoSQL database therefore the database is different from a traditional Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and instead of using tables, it uses a Document approach where a document stores all data related to it and the database consists of a Collection of documents.

Enjoy!
